Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But this... does put a smile on my face.
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.
I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you've shown me, that's impossible.
I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless.
Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
You have my respect. I hope they remember you.
I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.
You should have gone for the head.
I used the stones to destroy the stones.
I am... inevitable.
Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources, finite... 
If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.
I ignored my destiny once, I can not do that again. Even for you. I'm sorry, little one.
Fine. I'll do it myself.
The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose beyond temptation.
With all six stones, I can simply snap my fingers, they would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.
You should choose your words more carefully.
You were going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that.
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.
You're strong, but I could snap my fingers and you'd all cease to exist.
I will shred this universe down to its last atom and then, with the stones you've collected for me, create a new one...a grateful universe.
It's a small price to pay for salvation.
They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass.
Today, I lost more than you could know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all.
It nearly killed me, but the work is done.
It is not what is lost but only what it is been given... a grateful universe.
